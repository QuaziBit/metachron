# Metachron Core

**Metachron is in early development. The chain of human time is forming.**

Metachron is a human-centered cryptocurrency where time defines value. Its supply is dynamically anchored to global population and average human lifespan ‚Äî updated through democratic consensus, not arbitrary halving cycles.
